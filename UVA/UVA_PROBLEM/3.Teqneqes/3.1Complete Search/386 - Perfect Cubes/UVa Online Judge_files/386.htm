For hundreds of years Fermat's Last Theorem, which stated simply that
for <i>n</i> &gt; 2 there exist no
integers <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> &gt; 1 such that  <img alt="tex2html_wrap_inline27" src="386_data/386img1.gif" align="MIDDLE" height="26" width="94">  , has remained
elusively unproven. (A recent proof is
believed to be correct, though it is still undergoing scrutiny.)
It is possible, however, to find integers
greater than 1 that satisfy the ``perfect cube'' equation
 <img alt="tex2html_wrap_inline29" src="386_data/386img2.gif" align="MIDDLE" height="30" width="127">  (e.g. a quick calculation
will show that the equation  <img alt="tex2html_wrap_inline31" src="386_data/386img3.gif" align="MIDDLE" height="30" width="145">  is indeed true).
This problem requires that you
write a program to find all sets of numbers {<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>} which
satisfy this equation for  <img alt="tex2html_wrap_inline35" src="386_data/386img4.gif" align="MIDDLE" height="25" width="57"> .

</p><h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
The output should be listed as shown below, one perfect cube per
line, in non-decreasing order of
<i>a</i> (i.e. the lines should be sorted by their a values). The values
of <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i> should also be listed
in non-decreasing order on the line itself. There do exist several
values of a which can be produced
from multiple distinct sets of <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i> triples. In these
cases, the triples with the smaller <i>b</i> values should be listed first.

</p><p>
The first part of the output is shown here:
</p><p>
</p><pre>Cube = 6, Triple = (3,4,5)
Cube = 12, Triple = (6,8,10)
Cube = 18, Triple = (2,12,16)
Cube = 18, Triple = (9,12,15)
Cube = 19, Triple = (3,10,18)
Cube = 20, Triple = (7,14,17)
Cube = 24, Triple = (12,16,20)</pre>

<b>Note:</b> The programmer will need to be concerned with an efficient
implementation. The official
time limit for this problem is 2 minutes, and it is indeed possible to
write a solution to this problem
which executes in under 2 minutes on a 33 MHz 80386 machine.
Due to the distributed nature of
the contest in this region, judges have been instructed to make
the official time limit at their site
the greater of 2 minutes or twice the time taken by the judge's
solution on the machine being used to judge this problem.
