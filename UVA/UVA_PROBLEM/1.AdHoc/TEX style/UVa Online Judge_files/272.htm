TeX is a typesetting language developed by Donald Knuth. It takes source
text together with a few typesetting instructions and produces, one hopes,
a beautiful document. Beautiful documents use `` and "
to delimit quotations, rather than the mundane <tt>"</tt> which is what is provided
by most keyboards. Keyboards typically do not have an oriented double-quote,
but they do have a left-single-quote <tt>`</tt> and a right-single-quote <tt>'</tt>. Check
your keyboard now to locate the left-single-quote key <tt>`</tt> (sometimes called
the ``backquote key") and the right-single-quote key <tt>'</tt> (sometimes
called the ``apostrophe" or just ``quote"). Be careful
not to confuse the left-single-quote <tt>`</tt> with the ``backslash" key
<code>\</code>. TeX lets the user type two left-single-quotes <tt>``</tt> to create a left-double-quote ``
and two right-single-quotes <tt>''</tt> to create a right-double-quote ''. Most typists,
however, are accustomed to delimiting their quotations with the un-oriented
double-quote <tt>"</tt>.
</p><p>
</p><p>
If the source contained
</p><p>
<tt>"To be or not to be," quoth the bard, "that is the question."</tt>
</p><p>
then the typeset document produced by TeX would not contain the desired
form:
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
``To be or not to be," quoth the bard, ``that is the question."
</p><p>
</p><p>
In order to produce the desired form, the source file must
contain the sequence:
</p><p>
<tt>``To be or not to be,'' quoth the bard, ``that is the question.''</tt>
</p><p>
</p><p>
You are to write a program which converts text containing double-quote (<tt>"</tt>)
characters into text that is identical except that double-quotes have been
replaced by the two-character sequences required by TeX for delimiting quotations
with oriented double-quotes. The double-quote (<tt>"</tt>) characters should
be replaced appropriately by either <tt>``</tt> if the <tt>"</tt> opens a quotation and
by <tt>''</tt> if the <tt>"</tt> closes a quotation. Notice that the question of nested
quotations does not arise: The first <tt>"</tt> must be replaced by <tt>``</tt>, the
next by <tt>''</tt>, the next by <tt>``</tt>, the next by <tt>''</tt>, the next by <tt>``</tt>, the next by <tt>''</tt>, and so on.

<p>
Input will consist of several lines of text containing an even number of
double-quote (<tt>"</tt>) characters. Input is ended with an end-of-file character.
The text must be output exactly as it was input except that:
</p><p>
</p><ul><li> the first <tt>"</tt> in each pair is replaced by two <tt>`</tt> characters: <tt>``</tt> and</li><li> the second <tt>"</tt> in each pair is replaced by two <tt>'</tt> characters: <tt>''</tt>.
